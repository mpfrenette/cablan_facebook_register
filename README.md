# cablan_facebook_register
This old extension from July 2010 then allows visitors to a TYPO3 site to register via Facebook as Front-end users. The API changes with Facebook since then, but the extension was used a lot in conjunction with fbconnect which allowed to login, but not register using Facebook.
